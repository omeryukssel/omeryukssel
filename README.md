<h2 align="left">ðŸ‘‹Hello, Iâ€™m Ã–mer YÃ¼ksel!</h2>

###

<p align="left">I am a junior test engineer passionate about delivering high-quality software. Although I am early in my career, I am eager to learn and apply various testing techniques to ensure the reliability and functionality of applications. I specialize in both manual and automated testing, focusing on ensuring applications perform well and meet user expectations.
I have experience using Selenium for web automation and Postman for API testing. Iâ€™m also familiar with JUnit and TestNG for unit testing and test management. I use Git for version control and Jenkins for continuous integration, which streamline the testing process.

For mobile testing, I work with Appium, enabling automated tests for both Android and iOS applications. Additionally, I leverage Cucumber for Behavior Driven Development (BDD), creating clear and understandable test scenarios for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

I am continuously improving my skills in areas such as regression, load testing, and SQL for database testing. I value collaboration and clear communication, working closely with developers to ensure the delivery of high-quality software.</p>
